## Deployment


1.Download the necessary files. #images and videos

2.Import the following Libraries below mentioned.

3.Re-size all the images to this.

4.Import the Vgg 16 library as shown below and add 
preprocessing layer to the front of VGG.

5.tell the model what cost and optimization method to use.

6.Use the Image Data Generator to import the images from the dataset.

7.Make sure you provide the same target size as initialied for the image size.

8.fit the model & Run the cell. It will take some time to execute.

9.plot the loss & Accuracy.

10.save it as a h5 file
